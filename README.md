# Random scripts I write

You'll need xdotool and wmctrl to use these scripts.

I encrypt my Chromium install since it is the only thing that I really care about on my PC. This gives it an added layer of security.

I use xdotool for a few things, one of them being an auto clicker since I enjoy clicker games. I don't enjoy clicking though.
